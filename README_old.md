# W1D2 - Breakout on Scope (and reading code as a dev)

[Today's code](https://gist.github.com/NimaBoscarino/fcf2d80177bc4986f138e5b856bc2832)

Goals: 
1) Read code
   1) As a general programmer
   2) As a JAVASCRIPT programmer
  - read and evaluate code in our heads
    - not just from top to bottom, but as a computer would run it
2) A rudimentary understanding of SCOPES
  - scope chain (call stack)
    - identify different levels of scope

We used Javascript Tutor (http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)

Take a look at other instructor's lecture notes as well! There's tons of great stuff on Compass :)

Here are some examples from one of the other times that I did this lecture: https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/scope-notes
