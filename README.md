# W1D2: Scopes and Reading Code

[See the code and notes on GitHub](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/scope-notes)

We used Javascript Tutor (http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit)

Take a look at other instructor's lecture notes as well! There's tons of great stuff on Compass :)

## Goals:

1) Read code
   1) As a general programmer
   2) As a JAVASCRIPT programmer
  - read and evaluate code in our heads
    - not just from top to bottom, but as a computer would run it
2) A rudimentary understanding of SCOPES
  - scope chain (call stack)
    - identify different levels of scope

## The Gauntlet

Nima's trademarked ideal method for learning to read JavaScript. This is made up of...

### 9 Snippets of Code that will Change Your Life!!

See the code in `snippets.js`. I've removed the actual outputs, so you'll have to run the code yourself to see what happens ðŸ˜‡

### Python Tutor

Interactive JavaScript runner (see how your code runs!)

Use this! It's the BEST for revealing what's going on underneath the hood. I recommend using this to verify that your assignments this week are running the way that you _expect_ them to.

## Final Thoughts

I hope you enjoyed the breakout! As I mentioned, scope in JavaScript has a _tiny_ bit of more nuance, which you're going to learn about early next week. Keep up the great work!

Cheers,
Nima ðŸ•º
